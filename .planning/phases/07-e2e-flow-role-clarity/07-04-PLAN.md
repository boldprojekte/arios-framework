<objective>
Create user-facing documentation: enhanced in-CLI help and README updates.

Purpose: Users can look up when to use each command and understand how ARIOS works without reading code. Per CONTEXT.md: "Implementation first, docs after verified working" - this plan runs after workflow changes are implemented.

Output: Updated help.md with detailed command guidance, updated README.md with user-focused workflow and architecture sections.

## ARIOS Commands

### Workflow Commands (in order)

| Command | Purpose | Prerequisites |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `/ideate` | Explore ideas, clarify requirements | None (can run anytime) |
| `/plan` | Create execution plan from ideation | Requires CONTEXT.md |
| `/execute` | Build from plan, wave by wave | Requires PLAN.md |

### Entry & Utility

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/arios` | Start here - detects state, suggests next action |
| `/arios:status` | Check current position anytime |
| `/arios:help` | This reference |
| `/arios:init` | Initial project setup (CLI) |
| `/arios:start` | Complete setup after init |

### Typical Flow

```
/arios          Detects fresh project
    |
/ideate         Explore what to build
    |           (creates CONTEXT.md)
/plan           Structure the approach
    |           (creates PLAN.md)
/execute        Build it wave by wave
    |           (checkpoints verify each wave)
Done!
```

### Prerequisites Explained

- **CONTEXT.md** - Created by `/ideate`. Contains ideation findings, requirements, decisions.
- **PLAN.md** - Created by `/plan`. Contains execution tasks organized into waves.

If you run a command without its prerequisite, you'll see a clear message explaining what to run first.

### Behind the Scenes

ARIOS uses specialized agents for heavy work:

| You Run | ARIOS Spawns | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| `/ideate` | Researcher | Investigates external knowledge, codebase patterns |
| `/plan` | Planner | Creates structured execution plans |
| `/execute` | Executor | Implements tasks from the plan |

You see summaries from the orchestrator. Full details available via Ctrl+O.

### Tips

- Run `/clear` between stages for fresh context
- `/ideate` works anytime - for new features or research
- `/arios` is your friendly starting point
- Checkpoints verify each wave before proceeding
- If something fails, ARIOS tries to fix it (3 attempts) before asking you
```
```

Key changes from current:
- Added Prerequisites column to workflow table
- Added "Prerequisites Explained" section
- Added "Behind the Scenes" section explaining orchestrator/subagent pattern
- Updated tips to reflect new behavior

# ARIOS

AI-assisted development workflow for Claude Code.

## What ARIOS Does

ARIOS helps you build software by:
1. **Understanding what you want** before writing code
2. **Planning the approach** with clear structure
3. **Building professionally** with quality checks at each step

## Quick Start

```bash
# In your project directory
npx arios init

# Then in Claude Code
/arios
```

## Workflow

```
/arios      Start here - ARIOS detects your project state
   |
/ideate     Explore ideas, clarify requirements
   |        Creates: CONTEXT.md
/plan       Structure the implementation approach
   |        Creates: PLAN.md with tasks in waves
/execute    Build it wave by wave
   |        Runs checkpoints to verify each wave
Done!
```

### Commands

| Command | What it does | When to use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/arios` | Smart entry point | Always start here |
| `/ideate` | Creative exploration | New features, research, direction changes |
| `/plan` | Create execution plan | After ideation, when ready to build |
| `/execute` | Run the plan | After planning, to build the feature |
| `/arios:status` | Show progress | Check where you are anytime |
| `/arios:help` | Command reference | Quick lookup |

### Tips

- **Run `/clear` between stages** - Keeps context fresh
- **`/ideate` works anytime** - Not just for new projects
- **Checkpoints verify each wave** - Catches issues early
- **ARIOS tries to fix failures** - 3 automatic attempts before asking you

## How it Works

ARIOS uses an **orchestrator pattern**:

```
You run /ideate
       |
       v
  Orchestrator
       |
       v
  Spawns Researcher agent
       |
       v
  Researcher investigates, writes findings
       |
       v
  Orchestrator summarizes for you
       |
       v
  You see: "Research complete: 3 patterns found. See CONTEXT.md"
```

**What you see:** Orchestrator summaries and prompts
**What happens behind the scenes:** Specialized agents do the heavy lifting

### Agents

| Agent | Purpose | When spawned |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Researcher | Investigate approaches, patterns | During `/ideate` |
| Planner | Create execution structure | During `/plan` |
| Executor | Implement tasks | During `/execute` |

### Files ARIOS Creates

```
.planning/
  STATE.md        Your progress, decisions, context
  config.json     Project settings
  phases/
    01-name/
      01-CONTEXT.md   Ideation findings
      01-01-PLAN.md   Execution plan
      01-01-SUMMARY.md Results
```
