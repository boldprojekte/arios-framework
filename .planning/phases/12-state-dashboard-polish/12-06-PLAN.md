<objective>
Human verification of complete Phase 12 functionality.

Purpose: Verify all Phase 12 features work together end-to-end before marking milestone complete.
Output: User-tested confirmation that STATE-01, STATE-02, DASH-01, DASH-02 requirements are met.

<tasks>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Verify session resume and state validation</name>
  <what-built>
  - Action-first resume UX showing phase name + last task with [Continue] [Status] [Other] buttons
  - Drift detection before /execute that auto-fixes checksum mismatches
  - User prompt for state/file mismatches with Fix/Reset/Abort options
  - Auto-continue for interrupted tasks without restart/skip prompt
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  1. Start a test project with ARIOS, run /ideate and /plan to create state
  2. Close Claude Code completely
  3. Reopen Claude Code and run /arios
  4. Verify: You see minimal resume display (phase name + last task) with action buttons
  5. Run /execute to test drift detection (should pass silently or auto-fix)
  6. Manually edit STATE.md to claim a plan is complete that has no SUMMARY.md
  7. Run /execute again
  8. Verify: You're prompted with "State drift detected" and three options
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "session-verified" if resume and drift detection work, or describe issues</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Verify dashboard slide-out panel and notes</name>
  <what-built>
  - Slide-out detail panel from right (replaces modal)
  - Main view compresses when panel opens
  - Panel is resizable via drag handle
  - Notes section in panel with add-note capability
  - Notes written to PLAN.md frontmatter
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  1. Start dashboard: `npx arios dashboard` or equivalent
  2. Open browser to http://localhost:3456
  3. Click any task in Kanban or List view
  4. Verify: Panel slides in from right, main content compresses
  5. Drag the left edge of panel to resize
  6. Verify: Panel width changes, main content margin adjusts
  7. Type a note in the textarea and click "Add Note"
  8. Verify: Note appears in notes list with timestamp
  9. Check the PLAN.md file for the task
  10. Verify: notes array exists in frontmatter with your note
  11. Press Escape or click X
  12. Verify: Panel closes, main content returns to full width
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "dashboard-verified" if panel and notes work, or describe issues</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Verify Feature-Mode folder structure</name>
  <what-built>
  - Feature-Mode creates folders at .planning/features/feature-{name}/
  - Feature state file at feature folder/STATE.md
  - Plans written to feature folder
  - Archive behavior on feature completion
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  1. Run /arios and describe a small feature ("add logout button")
  2. When asked, confirm Feature-Mode
  3. Run /ideate to complete ideation
  4. Verify: .planning/features/feature-{name}/ folder exists with STATE.md
  5. Run /plan to create plans
  6. Verify: Plans are in .planning/features/feature-{name}/ not .planning/phases/
  7. (Optional) Complete the feature and verify it archives to .planning/archive/
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "feature-mode-verified" if folder structure works, or describe issues</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
All three checkpoints must pass:
- session-verified: Resume and drift detection work
- dashboard-verified: Panel and notes work
- feature-mode-verified: Feature folder structure works
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- STATE-01: Session resume picks up exactly where left off
- STATE-02: Drift detection runs before execute, handles mismatches appropriately
- DASH-01: Slide-out panel with resize replaces modal
- DASH-02: Notes feature allows user-to-Claude communication
- Feature-Mode isolation: Separate folder structure works
</success_criteria>

<output>
After all checkpoints pass, create `.planning/phases/12-state-dashboard-polish/12-06-SUMMARY.md`

Mark Phase 12 complete. v1.1 milestone is finished.
</output>
