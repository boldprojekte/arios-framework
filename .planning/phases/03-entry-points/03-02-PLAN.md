<objective>
Create the three core ARIOS workflow commands (/ideate, /plan, /execute) and a help command that provides command reference.

Purpose: Users need direct entry points to each ARIOS workflow phase, plus a reference for available commands.

Output: Four slash command files that enable workflow entry and provide documentation.

  <action>
Create three workflow entry commands following the Input-Workflow-Output template. These share a common structure but with workflow-specific behavior.

**Common pattern for all three:**

Frontmatter:
- description: Enter ARIOS [ideation/planning/execution] workflow
- No model specified (use user's default)

Structure:
1. Purpose: One-line about entering the specific workflow
2. Variables: $ARGUMENTS for any user input
3. Context section:
   - `!ls .arios/ 2>/dev/null || echo "NO_ARIOS"`
   - @.arios/STATE.md
   - @.arios/config.json
4. Instructions with:
   - Show brief status line: "Phase X/Y, Plan M/N"
   - Check prerequisites and warn if out of sequence
   - Allow continuation with confirmation
5. Workflow steps
6. Report format

**Workflow-specific differences:**

**/arios:ideate** (ideate.md):
- Purpose: Creative exploration for new features or project direction
- Prerequisites: ARIOS initialized (no strict prerequisite - ideation available anytime per CONTEXT.md)
- Out-of-sequence: None - ideation is always valid
- Action: Route to orchestrator with research mode, user provides topic
- Workflow:
  1. Check ARIOS initialized
  2. Show status line
  3. Ask user for ideation topic/question
  4. Route to /arios:orchestrate research with topic
  5. Show next step: "Next: /arios:plan"

**/arios:plan** (plan.md):
- Purpose: Create or continue a plan from ideation findings
- Prerequisites: Ideation/research complete (findings exist)
- Out-of-sequence warning: "No findings found. Run /arios:ideate first, or continue anyway?"
- Action: Route to orchestrator with plan mode
- Workflow:
  1. Check ARIOS initialized
  2. Show status line
  3. Check for findings file
  4. If no findings: warn, ask confirmation
  5. Route to /arios:orchestrate plan
  6. Show next step: "Next: /arios:execute"

**/arios:execute** (execute.md):
- Purpose: Execute tasks from the current plan
- Prerequisites: Plan exists
- Out-of-sequence warning: "No plan found. Run /arios:plan first, or continue anyway?"
- Action: Route to orchestrator with execute mode
- Workflow:
  1. Check ARIOS initialized
  2. Show status line
  3. Check for plan file
  4. If no plan: warn, ask confirmation
  5. Route to /arios:orchestrate execute
  6. Show completion or next wave info

Each command should be 40-60 lines. Follow lean prompt philosophy.

  <verify>All three files exist with proper frontmatter and template sections</verify>
  <done>The /arios:ideate, /arios:plan, and /arios:execute commands exist with status display, prerequisite checking, and orchestrator routing</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create help command</name>
  <files>packages/arios-cli/templates/.claude/commands/arios/help.md</files>
  <action>
Create the /arios:help command as a reference for available ARIOS commands.

**Frontmatter:**
- description: Show ARIOS command reference

**Structure:**
1. Purpose: Display available ARIOS commands and usage
2. No Context section needed (static content)
3. Instructions: Display the command reference
4. Report section with all commands:

```
## ARIOS Commands

**Entry Points:**
- /arios - Smart entry, detects state and suggests next action
- /arios:ideate - Creative exploration for features or direction
- /arios:plan - Create or continue a plan
- /arios:execute - Execute tasks from current plan

**Utilities:**
- /arios:status - Show current project position
- /arios:help - This reference
- /arios:start - Initial project setup (run after arios init)
- /arios:update - Update ARIOS to latest version

**Workflow:**
1. Initialize: `arios init` (CLI)
2. Setup: /arios:start
3. Work: /arios:ideate → /arios:plan → /arios:execute
4. Check: /arios:status anytime

**Tips:**
- Use /arios to auto-detect what to do next
- /arios:ideate works anytime, not just for new projects
- Commands warn but don't block if run out of sequence
```

Keep under 50 lines. Static documentation command.

  <verify>File exists at packages/arios-cli/templates/.claude/commands/arios/help.md</verify>
  <done>The /arios:help command displays all available commands with descriptions and workflow guide</done>

<verification>
- [ ] /arios:ideate exists with proper template structure
- [ ] /arios:plan exists with prerequisite checking
- [ ] /arios:execute exists with prerequisite checking
- [ ] /arios:help exists with complete command reference
- [ ] All workflow commands show status line before action
- [ ] Out-of-sequence warnings allow continuation with confirmation
- [ ] Commands route to orchestrate.md, not duplicate logic
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- All four command files exist with proper frontmatter
- Workflow commands show brief status and check prerequisites
- Out-of-sequence commands warn but don't block
- Help command lists all available commands with workflow guidance
- Commands stay lean and route to orchestrator for heavy work
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-entry-points/03-02-SUMMARY.md`
