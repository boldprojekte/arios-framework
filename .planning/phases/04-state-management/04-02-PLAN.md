<objective>
Integrate state persistence into ARIOS slash commands for session continuity.

Purpose: Enable users to resume work seamlessly by having /arios detect existing state and adapt its behavior accordingly.

Output: Updated slash commands that are state-aware, showing appropriate context on resume and detecting conflicts.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update /arios command for state awareness</name>
  <files>packages/arios-cli/templates/.claude/commands/arios/arios.md</files>
  <action>
Update the main /arios entry point to detect and respond to existing state.

Add state detection logic:

1. **Check for existing state:**
   - Look for .planning/STATE.md
   - If exists, this is a RESUME session
   - If not exists, check for .planning/ directory (brownfield) or nothing (greenfield)

2. **Resume flow (STATE.md exists):**
   - Load state frontmatter
   - Check for conflict (stored checksum vs calculated)
   - If conflict: Show collaborative message (per CONTEXT.md):
     "State file was modified. Something changed since last session.
     (continue with loaded state / describe what changed)"
   - If no conflict: Show mini status table (per CONTEXT.md):
     ```
     | Phase | Plan | Status |
     |-------|------|--------|
     | 2/6   | 1/3  | in-progress |
     ```
   - Offer choice: "Continue with Phase 2, or explore other options?"

3. **Fresh start flow (no STATE.md):**
   - Existing brownfield/greenfield detection (keep current logic)
   - After routing, state will be created by orchestrator

4. **Key CONTEXT.md requirements:**
   - Mini table + brief text (not verbose paragraphs)
   - Suggestions offer choice ("Continue with X, or do something else?") - not assertive
   - Never auto-fix conflicts - ask user

Keep the existing routing logic for greenfield/brownfield cases. Add the resume path as a FIRST check before those.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read the updated arios.md and confirm:
- Contains STATE.md check at the beginning
- Has mini table format for status
- Has collaborative conflict message
- Preserves existing greenfield/brownfield logic
  </verify>
  <done>
/arios command detects resume sessions, displays mini status table, handles conflicts collaboratively, and offers non-assertive suggestions.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update /arios:status for state-based display</name>
  <files>packages/arios-cli/templates/.claude/commands/arios/status.md</files>
  <action>
Update the status command to read from STATE.md and display formatted state.

Implement status display:

1. **Load state:**
   - Read .planning/STATE.md
   - If not found: "No project state found. Run /arios to get started."

2. **Display format (per CONTEXT.md - mini table + brief text):**
   ```
   ## Project Status

   | Phase | Plan | Status | Last Active |
   |-------|------|--------|-------------|
   | 2/6   | 1/3  | in-progress | 2026-01-24 |

   Currently working on: Phase 2 - Subagent System

   ### Recent Decisions
   - [2026-01-24] ESM-only with NodeNext module resolution
   - [2026-01-24] gray-matter for YAML frontmatter parsing

   ### Rejected Ideas
   - [2026-01-24] Full Handlebars templating (too complex for needs)
   ```

3. **Include decisions:**
   - Show last 5 positive decisions
   - Show last 3 negative decisions (if any)
   - Format: [date] decision text

4. **Suggestion at end:**
   - Non-assertive: "Continue with current phase, or /arios:help for other options?"

Keep output concise - this is a quick status check, not a full report.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read the updated status.md and confirm:
- Reads from STATE.md
- Has mini table format
- Shows decisions (positive and negative)
- Non-assertive suggestion at end
  </verify>
  <done>
/arios:status displays mini table with phase/plan position, recent decisions including rejected ideas, and non-assertive continuation suggestion.
  </done>
</task>

1. /arios command has three paths: resume (STATE.md exists), brownfield (no state but .planning), greenfield (nothing)
2. Status display uses mini table format per CONTEXT.md
3. Conflict detection asks user, doesn't auto-fix
4. Suggestions offer choice, not assertion
5. Negative decisions are displayed (per CONTEXT.md requirement)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Resume detection works (STATE.md present = resume flow)
- Mini table format matches CONTEXT.md specification
- Conflict handling is collaborative (ask user, never auto-fix)
- Suggestions use choice language ("Continue with X, or...")
- Status shows both positive and negative decisions
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-state-management/04-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
