<objective>
Wire checkpoint verification into execution flow with user pause.

Purpose: Close gap where verifyCheckpoint exists but is never called. Execution should pause at testable points where user can verify the app works.

Output: Updated orchestrate.md and execute.md with checkpoint verification flow.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add checkpoint config to execute command</name>
  <files>packages/arios-cli/templates/.claude/commands/arios/execute.md</files>
  <action>
Update /arios:execute to support checkpoint configuration:

1. Update Variables section:
   Add checkpoint config reference:
   ```
   **Static:** .planning/STATE.md, .planning/config.json, .planning/roadmaps/

   Checkpoint config (in .planning/config.json):
   - startCommand: Command to start the app (e.g., "npm run dev")
   - startReadyPattern: Regex to detect app is ready (e.g., "ready on|listening on")
   - testCommand: Command to run tests (e.g., "npm test")
   - startTimeout: Timeout for app start (default: 30000ms)
   - testTimeout: Timeout for tests (default: 120000ms)
   ```

2. Add to Instructions section:
   - After each wave, run checkpoint verification if configured
   - Checkpoint passes when: app runs successfully AND tests pass
   - Missing config = skip verification (nothing to verify)
   - On checkpoint failure: pause and show diagnostic, ask user to fix or continue

3. Update Workflow section after step 7 (Route to orchestrator):
   Insert new step 8: "Checkpoint verification"
   - If checkpoint config exists in .planning/config.json:
     * Run startCommand, wait for readyPattern or timeout
     * If app starts: run testCommand, check exit code
     * Display result: "Checkpoint: PASSED" or "Checkpoint: FAILED"
   - If no config: skip checkpoint (greenfield/early stages)

4. Update Report section:
   Add checkpoint status:
   ```
   Checkpoint: {PASSED|FAILED|SKIPPED}
   - App starts: {yes|no|n/a}
   - Tests pass: {yes|no|n/a}
   ```
  </action>
  <verify>
Read updated execute.md and confirm:
- Checkpoint config documented in Variables
- Checkpoint step in Workflow after orchestrator routing
- Checkpoint status in Report section
  </verify>
  <done>
execute.md includes checkpoint configuration and verification step
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add checkpoint verification to orchestrate command</name>
  <files>packages/arios-cli/templates/.claude/commands/arios/orchestrate.md</files>
  <action>
Update /arios:orchestrate to run checkpoint after each wave:

1. Update Workflow section, execution flow (step 5):
   After wave completion, add checkpoint verification:
   ```
   5. If execution needed:
      a. Build wave schedule from phase plan frontmatter
      b. For each wave in order:
         - Spawn executor(s) for plans in this wave
         - Wait for wave completion
         - **Run checkpoint verification:**
           * Read checkpoint config from .planning/config.json
           * If config exists:
             - Spawn startCommand, wait for readyPattern
             - If app ready: run testCommand
             - Determine: passed = appRuns AND testsPass
           * If checkpoint fails:
             - Display diagnostic: what failed and why
             - Prompt user: "Fix the issue and press Enter to re-verify, or type 'skip' to continue anyway"
             - If re-verify: repeat checkpoint
             - If skip: log warning and continue
         - Report wave + checkpoint status
   ```

2. Add checkpoint section to Spawn Patterns:
   ```
   **Checkpoint Verification:**
   After each wave completes:

   1. Read .planning/config.json for checkpoint config:
      - startCommand, startReadyPattern, testCommand, timeouts

   2. If config exists:
      a. Run start command (spawn process)
      b. Watch for ready pattern in stdout
      c. If ready or command exits 0: app runs = true
      d. If timeout or error: app runs = false

      e. If app runs: run test command
      f. If exit code 0: tests pass = true
      g. Else: tests pass = false

      h. passed = appRuns AND testsPass

   3. If no config: checkpoint skipped (return passed = true)
   ```

3. Add checkpoint status to Report section:
   ```
   ### Checkpoint Status
   Wave 1: ✓ Passed (app: ✓, tests: ✓)
   Wave 2: ✓ Passed (app: ✓, tests: ✓)
   Wave 3: ✗ Failed (app: ✓, tests: ✗)
           Error: 3 tests failed (see output above)
           Action needed: Fix failing tests before continuing
   ```

4. Add user interaction on failure:
   Document the pause-and-prompt behavior:
   - Show detailed failure output
   - Ask: "Fix issues and re-verify (Enter), skip (s), or abort (a)?"
   - Handle each option appropriately
  </action>
  <verify>
Read updated orchestrate.md and confirm:
- Checkpoint verification after each wave in Workflow
- Checkpoint section in Spawn Patterns
- Checkpoint status in Report section
- User interaction documented for failures
  </verify>
  <done>
orchestrate.md runs checkpoint after each wave with pause on failure
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Checkpoint verification flow wired into execute and orchestrate commands
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Read packages/arios-cli/templates/.claude/commands/arios/execute.md
   - Confirm checkpoint config documented
   - Confirm checkpoint step in workflow

2. Read packages/arios-cli/templates/.claude/commands/arios/orchestrate.md
   - Confirm checkpoint runs after each wave
   - Confirm user prompt on failure documented
   - Confirm checkpoint status in report

3. Verify the flow makes sense:
   - Wave completes → checkpoint runs → pass = continue, fail = prompt user
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe any issues</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Read both command files
2. Verify checkpoint verification is wired after wave completion
3. Verify user interaction on failure is documented
4. Verify checkpoint config location and format documented
5. Verify checkpoint status appears in reports
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Checkpoint runs automatically after each wave
- User is informed of checkpoint status (pass/fail/skip)
- Failed checkpoints pause execution and prompt user
- User can re-verify, skip, or abort
- Checkpoint config is documented and discoverable
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/05-execution-flow/05-09-SUMMARY.md`
